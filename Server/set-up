## Setting up an Remote Desktop Connection (RDP)

Suggestions: 
- Buy a raspberry pi or something, install linux with openvpn or similar on it and you cav vpn into it after opening https to the pi. 
  There are many howtos online. Easy and secure, you can even add two factor authentication (recommend).
  RDP has many flaws and can be broken into.

- Buying a device to use a VPN router, as it is pretty much more secured than setting up a Pi-VPN -- it has a lot of features where the device focuses in one thing.
