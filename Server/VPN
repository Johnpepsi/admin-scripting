## Setting up an Remote Desktop Connection (RDP)

Suggestions: 
- Buy a raspberry pi or something, install linux with openvpn or similar on it and you cav vpn into it after opening https to the pi. 
  There are many howtos online. Easy and secure, you can even add two factor authentication (recommend).
  RDP has many flaws and can be broken into.

- Buying a Beryl AX to use a VPN router, as it is pretty much more secured than setting up a Pi-VPN -- it has a lot of features where the device focuses in one thing.
- GL.iNet GL-MT3000 (Beryl AX) is more sufficient. Will get this today for $90, Raspberry pi would cost almost the same thing and would cost me time to set up OpenVPN or WireGuard.
